= MicroProfile Documentation

The link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[MicroProfile project] has several sources of information and collaboration. Since there is a large volume of activity, there is a need for important decisions to be recorded in one place for future reference. This is the aim of this repository.

=== Current Resources
The MicroProfile project is community-focused at its heart and aims to engage and encourage lively discussion through as many channels as possible.

===== Code, code, code
Several Eclipse github repos exist for the development of MicroProfile features...

link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile[MicroProfile] -- Top-level repo used to collect Microprofile-related information (this repo) +
link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-conference[MicroProfile Conference App] -- "Architectural Application" to demonstrate MicroProfile on a variety of vendors +
link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-samples[MicroProfile Samples] -- Simple sample application to demonstrate MicroProfile capabilities +
link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] -- Proposal for MicroProfile application configuration +
link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-evolution-process[MicroProfile Evolution Process] -- Process for developing new features for MicroProfile (under construction) +

===== Eclipse MicroProfile and Microprofile.io
The MicroProfile community recently moved to the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[Eclipse MicroProfile project].  
Although we now have this portal to our community at Eclipse, we will continue to maintain our external portal at link:http://microprofile.io[microprofile.io].
Both sites will be maintained to promote the development and use of MicroProfile in the industry.

===== Google Group
The link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile[Microprofile Google Group] is the preferred place for discussions to take place.

===== Mailing Lists
Besides the Google Group threads (main source of communication), there is also a link:https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/microprofile-dev[microprofile-dev mailing list] which should be used for conversation specific to the Eclipse way of doing things.
By using this mailing list, the Eclipse team can more quickly recognize and respond to our requests. +

Since the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[MicroProfile project] is still in incubation, another useful mailing list is the link:https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/incubation[incubation mailing list].

=== Notable Contributors
There is a very large number of people and vendors already involved in the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[MicroProfile project].
