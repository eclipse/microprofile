= Eclipse Foundation

In December 2016, the MicroProfile community was accepted into the Eclipse Foundation as the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[Eclipse MicroProfile project].

For historical purposes, the original proposal for this project is available link:https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-microprofile[here].
The full discussion on the proposal can be viewed in this link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/microprofile/sYMlGBI1qiM[MicroProfile Google Group post].

=== Why the Eclipse Foundation?
The Eclipse Foundation will give a structucture around which we can develop "link:https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/development_process.php#6_2_3_Incubation[the process, the community, and the technology]".

It quickly became apparent, after the MicroProfile effort began, that formal governance was needed to make sure the project remained transparent and open to contributions in a clear way. Rather than create a bespoke governance model, link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/microprofile/Y_8YCYa0JZ4/9o40cGjsBgAJ[there was a discussion about the issue] and link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/microprofile/aVX7G4QTP0A/CIrfzTn1GQAJ[the decision was taken to move the project to the Eclipse Foundation after a vote].
