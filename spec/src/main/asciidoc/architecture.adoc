[[architecture]]
== Architecture

The MicroProfile pom will identify the contents of each MicroProfile release.
The contents include those features and versions agreed to by the MicroProfile community.
These features may be external to the MicroProfile community, like those provided by Jakarta EE
Core Profile or the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (like OpenTelemetry),
or they are component specifications of the MicroProfile project (such as Config).

Since the MicroProfile repo is an "umbrella" project, no individual API or TCK is generated for this specification.
This specification documents the component specification contents of each release. An implementation can use later patch releases of component specifications.

The specifications for each release are listed in reverse chronological order.

[[microprofile6.1]]
=== MicroProfile 6.1
Based on MicroProfile's time-boxed release process, this is a minor release that does not include backward incompatible changes. Like MicroProfile 6.0, this release requires Jakarta EE Core Profile 10.

If you are still dependent on Jakarta EE 9.1, please consider using the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/5.0[5.0 release of MicroProfile].
If you are still dependent on Jakarta EE 8, please consider using the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/4.1[4.1 release of MicroProfile].

[[microprofile6.0]]
=== MicroProfile 6.0

MicroProfile 6.0 replaces required individual Jakarta specifications in prior releases like Jakarta Restful Web Services and JSON Binding with the Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile.

Based on MicroProfile's time-boxed release process, this is a major release that includes backward incompatible changes. This release requires Jakarta EE Core Profile 10, which uses the `jakarta` namespace introduced in Jakarta EE 9.

If you are still dependent on Jakarta EE 9.1, please consider using the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/5.0[5.0 release of MicroProfile].

[[microprofile5.0]]
=== MicroProfile 5.0

MicroProfile 5.0 aligns with the following specifications from Jakarta EE 9.1:

* Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 3.0
* Jakarta Annotations 2.0
* Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0
* Jakarta JSON Binding 2.0
* Jakarta JSON Processing 2.0

Based on MicroProfile's time-boxed release process, this is a major release that includes backwards incompatible changes. This means that this release will not work with previous versions of Jakarta EE, such as Jakarta EE 8, due to the namespace change from `javax` to `jakarta` in the code. This release contains no other functional updates when compared to MicroProfile Release 4.1.

=== MicroProfile 4.0 (Q42020)
// MicroProfile 4.0 is the 14th platform release for the
// https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[MicroProfile project].
MicroProfile 4.0 is based on Jakarta EE 8, the first MicroProfile release to
be based on Jakarta EE (replacing the role of Java EE).
Although Jakarta EE 8 is API backwards compatible with Java EE 8, Jakarta EE replaces Java EE dependencies with
Jakarta EE dependencies for all MicroProfile specifications.
