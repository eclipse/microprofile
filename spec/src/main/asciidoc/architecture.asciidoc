[[architecture]]
== Architecture

The MicroProfile pom will identify the contents of each MicroProfile release.
The contents will be those features and versions agreed to by the MicroProfile community.
These features may be external to the MicroProfile community (Jakarta EE features such as
Jakarta RESTful Web Services 2.1),
or they be a component of the MicroProfile project (such as Config 2.0).

Since the MicroProfile repo is an "umbrella" project, there will be no individual API or TCK generated for this component.
Only this Specification will be generated and maintained to document the contents of each release.

In reverse chronological order, here's the specification for each MicroProfile release.

[[microprofile4.1-RC2]]
=== MicroProfile 4.1-RC2 (Q32021)
MicroProfile 4.1-RC2 aligns with Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 2.0, Jakarta Annotations 1.3, Jakarta RESTful Web Services 2.1, Jakarta JSON Binding 1.0, and Jakarta JSON Processing 1.1.

Based on MicroProfile's time-boxed release process, this is an incremental release that includes an update to https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/releases/tag/3.1-RC3[MicroProfile Health 3.1-RC3]

If you are still dependent on Java EE 8, please consider using the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/3.3[3.3 release of MicroProfile].
If you are still dependent on Java EE 7, please consider using the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/1.4[1.4 release of MicroProfile].

MicroProfile 4.0 is based on Jakarta EE 8, the first MicroProfile release to
be based on Jakarta EE (replacing the role of Java EE).
