=== What is the MicroProfile?
MicroProfile is a collection of features designed for a microservice-focused platform.

===== What is the relationship with Java EE?
There is no formal relationship with Java EE. The 1.0 release of MicroProfile was based on three APIs (CDI, JSON-P and JAX-RS) which are Java EE APIs, but the MicroProfile effort is not limited to the Java EE APIs. Brand new APIs are equally as valid as established APIs.

===== What is the relationship with the JCP?
MicroProfile is not governed by the JCP. Rather, it is an independent effort governed under the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[Eclipse Foundation] and licensed under the link:https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache v2 Software License].

=== Who is involved?
Current vendors implementing MicroProfile specifications include:

* Red Hat (WildFly Swarm)
* IBM (WebSphere Open Liberty)
* Payara (Payara MicroProfile)
* Tomitribe (TomEE MicroProfile)
* Hammock (MicroProfile distribution)

A more complete list of the various MicroProfile implementations and the specification versions they support can be found on the link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/MicroProfile/Implementation[MicroProfile wiki].

There are link:http://microprofile.io/contributors[many individuals who contribute] to the MicroProfile project. The Java community as a whole is encouraged to take part and contribute to the project; there are no restrictions.

=== How can I get involved?
* Read through, comment on, and create new topics on the link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile[MicroProfile Google Group]
* Test the sample apps, fix bugs and submit a pull request, or create a new one (link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile/developer[Developer resources])
* Submit a proposal (link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/MicroProfile/FeatureInit[Introducing New Ideas to MicroProfile])

===== How do I join?
There is no formal "joining" process, since anyone is welcome to join the discussion in the link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile[Google Group].  Depending on how involved you want to be, however, you may need to sign an link:https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php[Eclipse Contributor Agreement] to contribute to the project.

===== How do I submit a proposal?
A process has been created specifically for the evolution of the MicroProfile, and can be found under link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/MicroProfile/FeatureInit[the Feature Initialization section of the wiki].

=== What are the logo restrictions?
Use of branding for any vendor is subject to the restrictions of that vendor.
