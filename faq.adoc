=== What is the MicroProfile?
MicroProfile is a collection of features designed for a microservice-focused platform.

===== What is the relationship with Java EE?
There is no formal relationship with Java EE. The 1.0 release of MicroProfile was based on three APIs (CDI, JSON-P and JAX-RS) which are Java EE APIs, but the MicroProfile effort is not limited to the Java EE APIs. Brand new APIs are equally as valid as established APIs.

===== What is the relationship with the JCP?
MicroProfile is not governed by the JCP. Rather, it is an independent effort governed under the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[Eclipse Foundation] and licensed under the link:https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache v2 Software License].

=== Who is involved?
Current vendors implementing version 1.0 of the MicroProfile include:

* Red Hat (WildFly Swarm)
* IBM (WebSphere Liberty)
* Payara (Payara MicroProfile)
* Tomitribe (TomEE MicroProfile)
* Hammock (MicroProfile distribution)

There are link:http://microprofile.io/contributors[many individuals who contribute] to the MicroProfile project. The Java community as a whole is encouraged to take part and contribute to the project; there are no restrictions.

=== How can I get involved?

* Submit a proposal (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-evolution-process/blob/master/process.md[evolution process])

===== How do I join?

Depending on how involved you want to be, however, you may need to sign an link:https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php[Eclipse Contributor Agreement] to contribute to the project.

===== How do I submit a proposal?
